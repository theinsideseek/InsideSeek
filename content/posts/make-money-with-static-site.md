# Build a Custom Website for Only $10.88 a Year: Free Static Site web Hosting

If you are someone who wants to make your personal website or Blog website, how to make money with static website, how to to get monetization in static website, add affiliate links, put sponsors and how to make money with static website, You can make it easily with all free and great resources, the only cost is to register a custom domain name. Of course there are some limitations: your site would not be a dynamic site, it will be a static site, So if it's not a big or commercial need or SaaS then you can get an easy and secure site after reading this article. There are two ways to do that one is writing manual HTML and CSS code another is using SSG (static site generator).

## Prerequisite 
In both ways you need little knowledge about HTML, CSS and Markdown (.md) file format, knowledge about IDE (Integrated Development Environment) Code editor like VS Code or Cursor. And to handle directory or folders, files, and version controllers (Git) and Code Drive in cloud like Gitlab or Github to deploy in the free hosting provider and maintain the version. If you want to go with an SSG (static site generator) like Hugo, Jekyll or Astro they have so many built in themes already all you need to so is Installing an SSG in your desktop and select a theme from your SSG's themes showcase which one looks perfect for the kind of site you are willing to make. These SSG can be used on Windows, MacOS, and Linux desktop. These are repository based and easy to use with CLI (Commend line interface).

## Making custom coded site even if you are beginner

Another way is writing HTML and CSS code manually. If you can write that is very good. You can use AI tools like Claude or Copilot. Claude or Copilot write your HTML and CSS code for your Static website you can customize then, You just need to prompt smartly.You can use any LLM models for that but I found Claude is better for coding related stuff. They will give you the code and you need to copy and paste in the Visual Studio Code to test how they look by using localhost. You can also prompt, generate and fix code inside VS Code or Cursor by expanding direct chatting options by selecting file, you can also select the LLM model you like there.

## The Technical Foundation: Static Site Architecture

The shift to static sites is driven by the realization that dynamic systems, which render pages on-the-fly using a server-side database, are inherently slower and more vulnerable to attack. A static site consists of pre-rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files served directly to the user. This architecture eliminates the database attack vector entirely and allows for near-instantaneous page loads.   

### Static Site Generators

Static Site Generators (SSGs) such as Hugo, Jekyll, and Astro have become the industry standard for high-performance publishing. Hugo, built in the Go language, is recognized as the fastest framework in its class, capable of building thousands of pages in milliseconds. Jekyll, conversely, remains a popular choice for documentation and simple portfolios due to its native integration with GitHub Pages. But if you want to make a blog to monetize ad-sense, sponsor as it will grow Hugo is suggested. 

The architectural choice between manual HTML/CSS/JS and an SSG depends on the project's scale. Manual coding offers total control but becomes unmanageable as the content grows. SSGs utilize Markdown (.md) for content, separating the data from the presentation layer through templates and layouts.

## Hugo Static Site Generator: The Fastest Way to Build Websites

Now suppose you want to go with Hugo. Because its most popular and powerful. The first step is to install Hugo on your desktop. Do it from (https://gohugo.io/installation/). Then use commend line to Create your site Directory/Folder:

```bash
hugo new site my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
```

After creating the site directory you need to initialize Git for version control:

```bash
git init
```

### How to Install Git on Different Operating Systems

To install Git, the commands vary by operating system. In Linux/macOS terminals, installation typically involves a single command using a package manager, while Windows generally uses a standalone installer.

#### Verifying Git Installation

Before installing, you can check if Git is already present by opening your terminal or command prompt and running:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git is installed, the version number will be displayed. Otherwise, follow the instructions for your specific OS below.

#### Installation Commands by Operating System

| Operating System | Installation Method/Command |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | Download the official installer from the Git website and run the executable file, accepting most default settings. Alternatively, use the winget tool or Chocolatey package manager. |
| **macOS** | **Command Line Tools:** Open your terminal and run `xcode-select --install` to install Git along with Xcode Command Line Tools. **Homebrew:** If you use Homebrew, run `brew install git` in the terminal. |
| **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)** | Update your package index and install Git using `apt`: `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt install git`. For the latest version, you can add the PPA first: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa`. |
| **Linux (Fedora)** | Use the `dnf` package manager: `sudo dnf install git`. |
| **Linux (CentOS/RHEL)** | Use the `yum` package manager: `sudo yum install git`. |
| **ChromeOS** | Enable the built-in Linux environment in settings, then use the Linux commands for Debian/Ubuntu above. |

After installation, it is recommended to restart your terminal and verify the installation with `git --version`.

### Choosing and Installing Hugo Themes (PaperMod Tutorial)

Now pick a theme from Hugo themes showcase (https://themes.gohugo.io/). Let's say you picked PaperMod theme which is clean and perfect for blogs. You can choose others available theme from theme section and will get install documentation there. Install PaperMod as a Git sub-module:

```bash
git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod
```

Then you need to configure your site. Open the `hugo.toml` or `config.toml` file in your code editor and add the theme:

```toml
baseURL = 'https://yoursite.com/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'My Awesome Blog'
theme = 'PaperMod'
```

### Creating Your First Blog Post with Markdown

Create your first blog post using this command:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

This will create a markdown file in the `content/posts` folder. Open it and start writing your content. The file will look something like this at the top:

```markdown
+++
title = "My First Post"
date = "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
draft = true
+++

Your content goes here...
```

### Local Preview with Hugo Server

To preview your site locally before deploying use this command:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

The `-D` flag means it will show draft posts too. Your site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`. You can see changes in real time as you edit your files.

When you're ready to build your site for production run:

```bash
hugo
```

This creates a `public` folder with all your static files ready to deploy.

## Free Static Site Hosting Options: Netlify vs GitHub Pages vs Cloudflare vs Vercel

There are multiple free hosting options and all of them are great. I recommend to use Netlify. Its widely recognize best options and no restriction for ad sense, affiliate marketing and sponsored content.

Here is how to use them:
### GitHub Pages: Free Website Hosting Tutorial

Push your code to GitHub repository then go to repository Settings > Pages > Select branch (usually main) > Save. Your site will be live at `username.github.io/repository-name`. For custom domain add a CNAME file in your repository or configure it in GitHub Pages settings.

Basic GitHub commands to push your code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Netlify Free Hosting, Pro Free Host

This is super easy. Go to Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/) and sign up with your GitHub or Google or Email account. Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project" > Select your repository > Configure build settings (for Hugo: Build command: `hugo`, Publish directory: `public`) > Deploy. That's it! Netlify gives you a custom subdomain and you can add your own domain for free.

### Cloudflare Pages: Fast CDN Hosting for Static Sites

Similar to Netlify. Go to Cloudflare Pages (https://pages.cloudflare.com/) > Sign up > Create a project > Connect your GitHub > Select repository > Configure build (Build command: `hugo`, Output directory: `public`) > Deploy. Cloudflare is known for its fast CDN and great performance.

### Vercel Free Hosting:

Best for Next.js and React Projects Vercel is also super good option for free hosting. Go to Vercel (https://vercel.com/) and sign up with your GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket account. Click "Add New" > "Project" > Import your repository > Vercel auto-detects framework (for Hugo: Build command: `hugo`, Output directory: `public`) > Deploy. That's it! Vercel gives you instant deployment with zero configuration. The best part about Vercel is if you're building with Next.js, React, or any modern JavaScript framework they have built-in support and optimization. Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js so it's the fastest option for React-based static sites and server-side rendered applications. You can also add your custom domain for free and they provide automatic SSL certificates. Vercel is perfect for developers who want advanced features like preview deployments, edge functions, and analytics without paying anything. 

**When to Choose Vercel:** 
- You're using Next.js, React, Vue, or Svelte frameworks 
- You need serverless functions alongside your static site 
- You want automatic preview URLs for every git push 
- You're building interactive web apps not just blogs Search on YouTube: "Vercel deployment tutorial" or "Deploy Next.js to Vercel free"

[Please note Vercel free version is not recommended if your goal is monetization, affiliate and other way of making money as it is strict to commercial use]
## Cheapest Domain Registration: Where to Buy Domains in 2026

Now the only cost part. You need a domain name to make your site look professional. I found Dynadot (https://www.dynadot.com/), Spaceship (https://www.spaceship.com) and Cloudflare (https://www.cloudflare.com/) offer great deals. A `.com` domain costs around 10-11 dollars per year. 

The reason I select Spaceship, Dynadot and Cloudflare is they charge the same amount for renew every year as registration cost. Specially, Spaceship cost only $9.88 which is cheapest among the market for a .com domain and it's also true for other TLD's. 

### Dynadot: Best Value Domain with Free Email Hosting

I recommend Dynadot, It will cost you only $10.88 every year with no increase and best part is you will get free hosting for your custom email under your domain with 1GB storage and Free hosting for one page static website with your domain. As long as you keep your domain with them and renew every year these email and website hosting is free forever, this kind of lucrative and great. Which other provider don't provide. 

You can use your custom email through Thunderbird and its includes one email address and email forwarding with gmail and outlook, which you can leverage for this purpose. And at least one custom email like (contact@yourdomain.com) for a website is absolute need. You can use it without extra hosting cost with Dynadot.

### Cloudflare Domain with Email Routing

You can also choose Cloudflare, its also a good option. But Cloudflare don't offer email hosting like Dynadot instead they offer email routing service which can received email to your gmail or outlook email but it's not good to send email from your custom address. 
### Spaceship
For spaceship they have dedicated email hosting service called space mail which is paid you can buy it as bundle with domain or hosting. But for this blog our goal is to Keep the cost maximum 11 a year. So, the solution is if you buy your domain from Spaceship you will use Zoho mail free version. It will allow to use Custom mail with their free forever plan. Its encrypted and secure. You need to use Zoho main app available in app store, play store and in desktop app.You can opt for the free custom email address plan, which includes 5GB for each user and email hosting for a single domain.    

### DNS Configuration for Custom Domain

After buying domain you need to configure DNS settings. If you're using Cloudflare Pages they will guide you to change name servers. For Netlify or GitHub Pages you need to add A records or CNAME records. Check your provider's documentation for exact steps. If you stuck there are many tutorials for each or ask Claude.
## Manual HTML, CSS Website Building (No Framework Needed)

If you want to code everything yourself that's totally fine and you'll learn a lot. Create an `index.html` file and write your HTML structure. Use CSS for styling. Keep your files organized in folders like `css/`, `js/`, `images/`. In this way you will learn by doing a very fundamental knowledge, which will give you a new path do anything you want further.

Basic structure example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Your content here...</p>
        </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2025 Your Name</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

You can deploy this exact same way to GitHub Pages, Netlify or Cloudflare. Just push your files to a repository and connect it to your hosting provider. Use LLM, YouTube for live guide or other available tools available to help you to make manually custom coded site and ensure you are doing and leaning at the same time not just copy and paste. If you know any Programming language like Java Script you can use Vercel's free hosting to make your site more functional.
**But remember vercel and github page is not good if you want monetization, affiliation and sponsored content in your site.**

## SEO Optimization for Static Websites: Get Traffic from Google

Don't forget to optimize your site for search engines. Add proper meta tags in your HTML head section. For Hugo or Jekyll this is done in the config file or in front matter of each page. Include meta description, Open Graph tags for social media sharing, and ensure your site is mobile responsive.

Basic meta tags example:

```html
<meta name="description" content="Your page description here">
<meta name="keywords" content="portfolio, blog, your keywords">
<meta property="og:title" content="Your Page Title">
<meta property="og:description" content="Your description">
<meta property="og:image" content="link-to-image.jpg">
```

Most Hugo and Jekyll themes already include these in their templates. You just need to configure them in your config file.

### Free SEO Tools for Blog Optimization

Although SEO is going to dead but still we need to care about for our blogs as of 2026. SEMRUSH and Ahref is still best option as SEO tools to analysis, research and management your SEO, But these are paid tools, although SEMRUSH have limited excess to keyword research everyday. I'm talking about a website that cost you only $10.88 for domain renew rest of all are free, reliable and good. So, use all the good things you are getting free.
## Free keyword analysis tool

**Google Keyword Planner** (Best for Paid keyword search), **SEMRUSH** (Advance SEM tool, 10 free search per day) **UberSuggest extension** (Limited free search per day), **KW finder** (Limited free search per day). These are great free tools to find keywords which have lower search difficulty. This is all you need to start writing your content later you can use other advance tools. Title, heading, subheadings, are is still most important for every article or blog post. Use your targeted keyword wisely there. You can use Gemini, Chatgpt and Claude also as your Keyword research. For example you are writing article about "Using Linux in mobile phone" you can prompt like that "I'm writing an article about using Linux in mobile phone. Do a deep research for me and in a table give me five top keyword mentioning search volume, search difficulty and top competitor article link for your suggested keyword".

## Why Static Sites Are Better Than Dynamic Websites in some ways

Building a static website is cheaper, faster and more secure than traditional dynamic sites. No database means no database attacks. No server-side code means faster loading times. And the best part? The only ongoing cost is your domain renewal which is around 10-11 dollars per year. Everything else is completely free.

### Performance Benefits

Static sites load in milliseconds because they're just HTML files served from a CDN. Dynamic sites need to query databases and run server code for every request. Google loves fast sites and ranks them higher.

### Security Advantages

No backend code means hackers can't inject SQL or exploit server vulnerabilities. Your site is just files on a CDN. The attack surface is minimal.

### Cost Savings

Free hosting + $10.88 domain = Total cost. Compare that to $5-50/month for traditional hosting plus domain fees. Over a year that's $60-600 saved.

## Take Action: Build Your First Static Website Today

Start small, learn as you go, and don't be afraid to break things. That's how you learn. The community around these tools is amazing and helpful. If you get stuck search for your error Someone has probably faced the same issue and solved it already. Search on Google or ask LLM.
