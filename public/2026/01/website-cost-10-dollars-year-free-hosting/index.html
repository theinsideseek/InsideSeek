Of course there are some limitations: your site would not be a dynamic site, it will be a static site, So if it’s not a big or commercial need or SaaS then you can get an easy and secure site after reading this article. There are two ways to do that one is writing manual HTML and CSS code another is using SSG (static site generator).\nPrerequisite In both ways you need little knowledge about HTML, CSS and Markdown (.md) file format, knowledge about IDE (Integrated Development Environment) Code editor like VS Code or Cursor. And to handle directory or folders, files, and version controllers (Git) and Code Drive in cloud like Gitlab or Github to deploy in the free hosting provider and maintain the version. If you want to go with an SSG (static site generator) like Hugo, Jekyll or Astro they have so many built in themes already all you need to so is Installing an SSG in your desktop and select a theme from your SSG’s themes showcase which one looks perfect for the kind of site you are willing to make. These SSG can be used on Windows, MacOS, and Linux desktop. These are repository based and easy to use with CLI (Commend line interface).\nMaking custom coded site even if you are beginner Another way is writing HTML and CSS code manually. If you can write that is very good. You can use AI tools like Claude or Copilot. Claude or Copilot write your HTML and CSS code for your Static website you can customize then, You just need to prompt smartly.You can use any LLM models for that but I found Claude is better for coding related stuff. They will give you the code and you need to copy and paste in the Visual Studio Code to test how they look by using localhost. You can also prompt, generate and fix code inside VS Code or Cursor by expanding direct chatting options by selecting file, you can also select the LLM model you like there.\nThe Technical Foundation: Static Site Architecture The shift to static sites is driven by the realization that dynamic systems, which render pages on-the-fly using a server-side database, are inherently slower and more vulnerable to attack. A static site consists of pre-rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files served directly to the user. This architecture eliminates the database attack vector entirely and allows for near-instantaneous page loads. Static Site Generators Static Site Generators (SSGs) such as Hugo, Jekyll, and Astro have become the industry standard for high-performance publishing. Hugo, built in the Go language, is recognized as the fastest framework in its class, capable of building thousands of pages in milliseconds. Jekyll, conversely, remains a popular choice for documentation and simple portfolios due to its native integration with GitHub Pages. But if you want to make a blog to monetize ad-sense, sponsor as it will grow Hugo is suggested.\nThe architectural choice between manual HTML/CSS/JS and an SSG depends on the project’s scale. Manual coding offers total control but becomes unmanageable as the content grows. SSGs utilize Markdown (.md) for content, separating the data from the presentation layer through templates and layouts.\nHugo Static Site Generator: The Fastest Way to Build Websites Now suppose you want to go with Hugo. Because its most popular and powerful. The first step is to install Hugo on your desktop. Do it from (https://gohugo.io/installation/). Then use commend line to Create your site Directory/Folder:\nhugo new site my-awesome-site cd my-awesome-site After creating the site directory you need to initialize Git for version control:\ngit init How to Install Git on Different Operating Systems To install Git, the commands vary by operating system. In Linux/macOS terminals, installation typically involves a single command using a package manager, while Windows generally uses a standalone installer.\nVerifying Git Installation Before installing, you can check if Git is already present by opening your terminal or command prompt and running:\ngit --version If Git is installed, the version number will be displayed. Otherwise, follow the instructions for your specific OS below.\nInstallation Commands by Operating System Operating System Installation Method/Command Windows Download the official installer from the Git website and run the executable file, accepting most default settings. Alternatively, use the winget tool or Chocolatey package manager. macOS Command Line Tools: Open your terminal and run xcode-select --install to install Git along with Xcode Command Line Tools. Homebrew: If you use Homebrew, run brew install git in the terminal. Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) Update your package index and install Git using apt: sudo apt update followed by sudo apt install git. For the latest version, you can add the PPA first: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa. Linux (Fedora) Use the dnf package manager: sudo dnf install git. Linux (CentOS/RHEL) Use the yum package manager: sudo yum install git. ChromeOS Enable the built-in Linux environment in settings, then use the Linux commands for Debian/Ubuntu above. After installation, it is recommended to restart your terminal and verify the installation with git --version.\nChoosing and Installing Hugo Themes (PaperMod Tutorial) Now pick a theme from Hugo themes showcase (https://themes.gohugo.io/). Let’s say you picked PaperMod theme which is clean and perfect for blogs. You can choose others available theme from theme section and will get install documentation there. Install PaperMod as a Git sub-module:\ngit submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod Then you need to configure your site. Open the hugo.toml or config.toml file in your code editor and add the theme:\nbaseURL = 'https://yoursite.com/' languageCode = 'en-us' title = 'My Awesome Blog' theme = 'PaperMod' Creating Your First Blog Post with Markdown Create your first blog post using this command:\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md This will create a markdown file in the content/posts folder. Open it and start writing your content. The file will look something like this at the top:\n+++ title = \"My First Post\" date = \"2025-01-15T10:00:00Z\" draft = true +++ Your content goes here... Local Preview with Hugo Server To preview your site locally before deploying use this command:\nhugo server -D The -D flag means it will show draft posts too. Your site will be available at http://localhost:1313. You can see changes in real time as you edit your files.\nWhen you’re ready to build your site for production run:\nhugo This creates a public folder with all your static files ready to deploy.\nFree Static Site Hosting Options: Netlify vs GitHub Pages vs Cloudflare vs Vercel There are multiple free hosting options and all of them are great. I recommend to use Netlify. Its widely recognize best options and no restriction for ad sense, affiliate marketing and sponsored content.\nHere is how to use them:\nGitHub Pages: Free Website Hosting Tutorial Push your code to GitHub repository then go to repository Settings \u003e Pages \u003e Select branch (usually main) \u003e Save. Your site will be live at username.github.io/repository-name. For custom domain add a CNAME file in your repository or configure it in GitHub Pages settings.\nBasic GitHub commands to push your code:\ngit add . git commit -m \"Initial commit\" git branch -M main git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git git push -u origin main Learn Git basics here: https://git-scm.com/doc\nGitHub Pages Video Tutorial:\nSearch on YouTube: “GitHub Pages deployment tutorial 2026”\nNetlify Free Hosting, Pro Free Host This is super easy. Go to Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/) and sign up with your GitHub or Google or Email account. Click “Add new site” \u003e “Import an existing project” \u003e Select your repository \u003e Configure build settings (for Hugo: Build command: hugo, Publish directory: public) \u003e Deploy. That’s it! Netlify gives you a custom subdomain and you can add your own domain for free.\nNetlify Deployment Video Tutorial:\nSearch on YouTube: “Hugo Netlify deployment tutorial” or “Netlify free hosting 2026”\nCloudflare Pages: Fast CDN Hosting for Static Sites Similar to Netlify. Go to Cloudflare Pages (https://pages.cloudflare.com/) \u003e Sign up \u003e Create a project \u003e Connect your GitHub \u003e Select repository \u003e Configure build (Build command: hugo, Output directory: public) \u003e Deploy. Cloudflare is known for its fast CDN and great performance.\nVercel Free Hosting: Best for Next.js and React Projects Vercel is also super good option for free hosting. Go to Vercel (https://vercel.com/) and sign up with your GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket account. Click “Add New” \u003e “Project” \u003e Import your repository \u003e Vercel auto-detects framework (for Hugo: Build command: hugo, Output directory: public) \u003e Deploy. That’s it! Vercel gives you instant deployment with zero configuration. The best part about Vercel is if you’re building with Next.js, React, or any modern JavaScript framework they have built-in support and optimization. Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js so it’s the fastest option for React-based static sites and server-side rendered applications. You can also add your custom domain for free and they provide automatic SSL certificates. Vercel is perfect for developers who want advanced features like preview deployments, edge functions, and analytics without paying anything.\nWhen to Choose Vercel:\nYou’re using Next.js, React, Vue, or Svelte frameworks You need serverless functions alongside your static site You want automatic preview URLs for every git push You’re building interactive web apps not just blogs Search on YouTube: “Vercel deployment tutorial” or “Deploy Next.js to Vercel free” [Please note Vercel free version is not recommended if your goal is monetization, affiliate and other way of making money as it is strict to commercial use]\nCheapest Domain Registration: Where to Buy Domains in 2026 Now the only cost part. You need a domain name to make your site look professional. I found Dynadot (https://www.dynadot.com/), Spaceship (https://www.spaceship.com) and Cloudflare (https://www.cloudflare.com/) offer great deals. A .com domain costs around 10-11 dollars per year.\nThe reason I select Spaceship, Dynadot and Cloudflare is they charge the same amount for renew every year as registration cost. Specially, Spaceship cost only $9.88 which is cheapest among the market for a .com domain and it’s also true for other TLD’s.\nDynadot: Best Value Domain with Free Email Hosting I recommend Dynadot, It will cost you only $10.88 every year with no increase and best part is you will get free hosting for your custom email under your domain with 1GB storage and Free hosting for one page static website with your domain. As long as you keep your domain with them and renew every year these email and website hosting is free forever, this kind of lucrative and great. Which other provider don’t provide.\nYou can use your custom email through Thunderbird and its includes one email address and email forwarding with gmail and outlook, which you can leverage for this purpose. And at least one custom email like (contact@yourdomain.com) for a website is absolute need. You can use it without extra hosting cost with Dynadot.\nCloudflare Domain with Email Routing You can also choose Cloudflare, its also a good option. But Cloudflare don’t offer email hosting like Dynadot instead they offer email routing service which can received email to your gmail or outlook email but it’s not good to send email from your custom address.\nSpaceship For spaceship they have dedicated email hosting service called space mail which is paid you can buy it as bundle with domain or hosting. But for this blog our goal is to Keep the cost maximum 11 a year. So, the solution is if you buy your domain from Spaceship you will use Zoho mail free version. It will allow to use Custom mail with their free forever plan. Its encrypted and secure. You need to use Zoho main app available in app store, play store and in desktop app.You can opt for the free custom email address plan, which includes 5GB for each user and email hosting for a single domain.\nDNS Configuration for Custom Domain After buying domain you need to configure DNS settings. If you’re using Cloudflare Pages they will guide you to change name servers. For Netlify or GitHub Pages you need to add A records or CNAME records. Check your provider’s documentation for exact steps. If you stuck there are many tutorials for each or ask Claude.\nManual HTML, CSS Website Building (No Framework Needed) If you want to code everything yourself that’s totally fine and you’ll learn a lot. Create an index.html file and write your HTML structure. Use CSS for styling. Keep your files organized in folders like css/, js/, images/. In this way you will learn by doing a very fundamental knowledge, which will give you a new path do anything you want further.\nBasic structure example:\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"UTF-8\"\u003e \u003cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eMy Portfolio\u003c/title\u003e \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/style.css\"\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cheader\u003e \u003ch1\u003eWelcome to My Portfolio\u003c/h1\u003e \u003c/header\u003e \u003cmain\u003e \u003csection\u003e \u003ch2\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour content here...\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/section\u003e \u003c/main\u003e \u003cfooter\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026copy; 2025 Your Name\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/footer\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e You can deploy this exact same way to GitHub Pages, Netlify or Cloudflare. Just push your files to a repository and connect it to your hosting provider. Use LLM, YouTube for live guide or other available tools available to help you to make manually custom coded site and ensure you are doing and leaning at the same time not just copy and paste. If you know any Programming language like Java Script you can use Vercel’s free hosting to make your site more functional. But remember vercel and github page is not good if you want monetization, affiliation and sponsored content in your site.\nStatic Site Deployment (SSG Deployment) How to make a website with Hugo Blowfish theme If you want to make a great static website with Hugo than this video is for you:\nTools use: Hugo, and its Blowfish theme, Git and Github.

Add proper meta tags in your HTML head section. For Hugo or Jekyll this is done in the config file or in front matter of each page. Include meta description, Open Graph tags for social media sharing, and ensure your site is mobile responsive.\nBasic meta tags example:\n\u003cmeta name=\"description\" content=\"Your page description here\"\u003e \u003cmeta name=\"keywords\" content=\"portfolio, blog, your keywords\"\u003e \u003cmeta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Your Page Title\"\u003e \u003cmeta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Your description\"\u003e \u003cmeta property=\"og:image\" content=\"link-to-image.jpg\"\u003e Most Hugo and Jekyll themes already include these in their templates. You just need to configure them in your config file.\nFree SEO Tools for Blog Optimization Although SEO is going to dead but still we need to care about for our blogs as of 2026. SEMRUSH and Ahref is still best option as SEO tools to analysis, research and management your SEO, But these are paid tools, although SEMRUSH have limited excess to keyword research everyday. I’m talking about a website that cost you only $10.88 for domain renew rest of all are free, reliable and good. So, use all the good things you are getting free.\nFree keyword analysis tool Google Keyword Planner (Best for Paid keyword search), SEMRUSH (Advance SEM tool, 10 free search per day) UberSuggest extension (Limited free search per day), KW finder (Limited free search per day). These are great free tools to find keywords which have lower search difficulty. This is all you need to start writing your content later you can use other advance tools. Title, heading, subheadings, are is still most important for every article or blog post. Use your targeted keyword wisely there. You can use Gemini, Chatgpt and Claude also as your Keyword research.

Static sites work perfectly with AdSense. Just add the ad code to your Hugo templates or HTML files. AdSense pays you when visitors click on ads displayed on your site.\nHow to Add AdSense to Hugo:\nAdd your AdSense script to layouts/partials/head.html or your theme’s header file.

Use services like:\nGumroad: Sell digital products easily Lemon Squeezy: Modern payment platform Payhip: Sell downloads and memberships Add buy buttons to your static site pages.\nWhy Static Sites Are Better Than Dynamic Websites in some ways Building a static website is cheaper, faster and more secure than traditional dynamic sites. No database means no database attacks. No server-side code means faster loading times. And the best part? The only ongoing cost is your domain renewal which is around 10-11 dollars per year. Everything else is completely free.\nPerformance Benefits Static sites load in milliseconds because they’re just HTML files served from a CDN. Dynamic sites need to query databases and run server code for every request. Google loves fast sites and ranks them higher.\nSecurity Advantages No backend code means hackers can’t inject SQL or exploit server vulnerabilities. Your site is just files on a CDN. The attack surface is minimal.\nCost Savings Free hosting + $10.88 domain = Total cost. Compare that to $5-50/month for traditional hosting plus domain fees. Over a year that’s $60-600 saved.\nTake Action: Build Your First Static Website Today Start small, learn as you go, and don’t be afraid to break things. That’s how you learn. The community around these tools is amazing and helpful. If you get stuck search for your error Someone has probably faced the same issue and solved it already. Search on Google or ask LLM.\nNow go build something awesome. At least a blog and try rank in google search.\nYour Step-by-Step Action Plan Choose your path: Hugo SSG or manual HTML/CSS Install tools: Git, VS Code, Hugo (if using SSG) Create your site: Follow tutorials above Pick a theme: Browse Hugo themes or design your own Write content: Create 5-10 blog posts or pages Buy domain: Get a .com from Dynadot or Spaceship Deploy free: Push to Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Cloudflare Configure DNS: Point your domain to hosting Set up SEO: Add meta tags, submit to Google Search Console Monetize: Apply for AdSense, add affiliate links Start building today if you put enough effort, you’ll have a professional website live within a weekend!\n(N.B.

Year: Free Static Site web Hosting<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#build-a-custom-website-for-only-1088-a-year-free-static-site-web-hosting>#</a></h1><p>If you are someone who wants to make your personal website or Blog website, how to make money with static website, how to to get monetization in static website, add affiliate links, put sponsors and how to make money with static website, You can make it easily with all free and great resources, the only cost is to register a custom domain name. Of course there are some limitations: your site would not be a dynamic site, it will be a static site, So if it&rsquo;s not a big or commercial need or SaaS then you can get an easy and secure site after reading this article. There are two ways to do that one is writing manual HTML and CSS code another is using SSG (static site generator).</p><h2 id=prerequisite>Prerequisite<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#prerequisite>#</a></h2><p>In both ways you need little knowledge about HTML, CSS and Markdown (.md) file format, knowledge about IDE (Integrated Development Environment) Code editor like VS Code or Cursor. And to handle directory or folders, files, and version controllers (Git) and Code Drive in cloud like Gitlab or Github to deploy in the free hosting provider and maintain the version. If you want to go with an SSG (static site generator) like Hugo, Jekyll or Astro they have so many built in themes already all you need to so is Installing an SSG in your desktop and select a theme from your SSG&rsquo;s themes showcase which one looks perfect for the kind of site you are willing to make. These SSG can be used on Windows, MacOS, and Linux desktop. These are repository based and easy to use with CLI (Commend line interface).</p><h2 id=making-custom-coded-site-even-if-you-are-beginner>Making custom coded site even if you are beginner<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#making-custom-coded-site-even-if-you-are-beginner>#</a></h2><p>Another way is writing HTML and CSS code manually. If you can write that is very good. You can use AI tools like Claude or Copilot. Claude or Copilot write your HTML and CSS code for your Static website you can customize then, You just need to prompt smartly.You can use any LLM models for that but I found Claude is better for coding related stuff. They will give you the code and you need to copy and paste in the Visual Studio Code to test how they look by using localhost. You can also prompt, generate and fix code inside VS Code or Cursor by expanding direct chatting options by selecting file, you can also select the LLM model you like there.</p><h2 id=the-technical-foundation-static-site-architecture>The Technical Foundation: Static Site Architecture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-technical-foundation-static-site-architecture>#</a></h2><p>The shift to static sites is driven by the realization that dynamic systems, which render pages on-the-fly using a server-side database, are inherently slower and more vulnerable to attack. A static site consists of pre-rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files served directly to the user. This architecture eliminates the database attack vector entirely and allows for near-instantaneous page loads.   </p><h3 id=static-site-generators>Static Site Generators<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#static-site-generators>#</a></h3><p>Static Site Generators (SSGs) such as Hugo, Jekyll, and Astro have become the industry standard for high-performance publishing. Hugo, built in the Go language, is recognized as the fastest framework in its class, capable of building thousands of pages in milliseconds. Jekyll, conversely, remains a popular choice for documentation and simple portfolios due to its native integration with GitHub Pages. But if you want to make a blog to monetize ad-sense, sponsor as it will grow Hugo is suggested.</p><p>The architectural choice between manual HTML/CSS/JS and an SSG depends on the project&rsquo;s scale. Manual coding offers total control but becomes unmanageable as the content grows. SSGs utilize Markdown (.md) for content, separating the data from the presentation layer through templates and layouts.</p><h2 id=hugo-static-site-generator-the-fastest-way-to-build-websites>Hugo Static Site Generator: The Fastest Way to Build Websites<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hugo-static-site-generator-the-fastest-way-to-build-websites>#</a></h2><p>Now suppose you want to go with Hugo. Because its most popular and powerful. The first step is to install Hugo on your desktop. Do it from (<a href=https://gohugo.io/installation/)>https://gohugo.io/installation/)</a>. Then use commend line to Create your site Directory/Folder:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>hugo new site my-awesome-site

Go to Vercel (<a href=https://vercel.com/>https://vercel.com/</a>) and sign up with your GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket account. Click &ldquo;Add New&rdquo; > &ldquo;Project&rdquo; > Import your repository > Vercel auto-detects framework (for Hugo: Build command: <code>hugo</code>, Output directory: <code>public</code>) > Deploy. That&rsquo;s it! Vercel gives you instant deployment with zero configuration. The best part about Vercel is if you&rsquo;re building with Next.js, React, or any modern JavaScript framework they have built-in support and optimization. Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js so it&rsquo;s the fastest option for React-based static sites and server-side rendered applications. You can also add your custom domain for free and they provide automatic SSL certificates. Vercel is perfect for developers who want advanced features like preview deployments, edge functions, and analytics without paying anything.</p><p><strong>When to Choose Vercel:</strong></p><ul><li>You&rsquo;re using Next.js, React, Vue, or Svelte frameworks</li><li>You need serverless functions alongside your static site</li><li>You want automatic preview URLs for every git push</li><li>You&rsquo;re building interactive web apps not just blogs Search on YouTube: &ldquo;Vercel deployment tutorial&rdquo; or &ldquo;Deploy Next.js to Vercel free&rdquo;</li></ul><p>[Please note Vercel free version is not recommended if your goal is monetization, affiliate and other way of making money as it is strict to commercial use]</p><h2 id=cheapest-domain-registration-where-to-buy-domains-in-2026>Cheapest Domain Registration: Where to Buy Domains in 2026<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cheapest-domain-registration-where-to-buy-domains-in-2026>#</a></h2><p>Now the only cost part. You need a domain name to make your site look professional. I found Dynadot (<a href=https://www.dynadot.com/)>https://www.dynadot.com/)</a>, Spaceship (<a href=https://www.spaceship.com>https://www.spaceship.com</a>) and Cloudflare (<a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/>https://www.cloudflare.com/</a>) offer great deals. A <code>.com</code> domain costs around 10-11 dollars per year.</p><p>The reason I select Spaceship, Dynadot and Cloudflare is they charge the same amount for renew every year as registration cost. Specially, Spaceship cost only $9.88 which is cheapest among the market for a .com domain and it&rsquo;s also true for other TLD&rsquo;s.</p><h3 id=dynadot-best-value-domain-with-free-email-hosting>Dynadot: Best Value Domain with Free Email Hosting<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dynadot-best-value-domain-with-free-email-hosting>#</a></h3><p>I recommend Dynadot, It will cost you only $10.88 every year with no increase and best part is you will get free hosting for your custom email under your domain with 1GB storage and Free hosting for one page static website with your domain. As long as you keep your domain with them and renew every year these email and website hosting is free forever, this kind of lucrative and great. Which other provider don&rsquo;t provide.</p><p>You can use your custom email through Thunderbird and its includes one email address and email forwarding with gmail and outlook, which you can leverage for this purpose. And at least one custom email like (<a href=mailto:contact@yourdomain.com>contact@yourdomain.com</a>) for a website is absolute need. You can use it without extra hosting cost with Dynadot.</p><h3 id=cloudflare-domain-with-email-routing>Cloudflare Domain with Email Routing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cloudflare-domain-with-email-routing>#</a></h3><p>You can also choose Cloudflare, its also a good option. But Cloudflare don&rsquo;t offer email hosting like Dynadot instead they offer email routing service which can received email to your gmail or outlook email but it&rsquo;s not good to send email from your custom address.</p><h3 id=spaceship>Spaceship<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#spaceship>#</a></h3><p>For spaceship they have dedicated email hosting service called space mail which is paid you can buy it as bundle with domain or hosting. But for this blog our goal is to Keep the cost maximum 11 a year. So, the solution is if you buy your domain from Spaceship you will use Zoho mail free version.
